# Demonstrations

The following demos showcase how MolViewSpec helps with creating interactive stories and visualizations.

## [MolViewSpec Stories](https://molstar.org/demos/mvs-stories/)

The combination of MolViewSpec and Mol* makes it easy to define engaging, interactive molecular stories, as showcased 
with the following two examples.
Their source code can be found

### [MolViewSpec Story: ABL Kinase](https://molstar.org/demos/mvs-stories/?story=kinase)

BCR-ABL is a classic case of how structural biology can drive drug discovery. This story will help you 
understand the role of BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia and how the drug Imatinib works.

### [MolViewSpec Story: TATA-Binding Protein](https://molstar.org/demos/mvs-stories/?story=tata)

Specialized DNA sequences next to genes, called promoters, define the proper start site and direction for transcription.
In eukaryotic cells, a complex promoter system ensures that the proper RNA polymerase is targeted to each gene.
The TATA-binding protein (TBP) is the central element of this system.

## [I/HM Restraints](https://molstar.org/demos/ihm-restraints/)

Visualize structural restraints for integrated hybrid models (I/HM). The source code can be found 
[here](https://github.com/molstar/molstar/tree/master/src/examples/ihm-restraints).
