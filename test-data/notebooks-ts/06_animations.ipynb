    "## Implementation Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Status\n",
    "\n",
    "The animation API shown in this notebook represents the expected interface based on\n",
    "the Python implementation. The TypeScript builder will need to implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Animation Builder Class**: Similar to other builder classes\n",
    "   ```typescript\n",
    "   export class Animation extends Base {\n",
    "     interpolate(params: InterpolationParams): Animation { ... }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Animation Method on Root**: Add to Root class\n",
    "   ```typescript\n",
    "   animation(params?: AnimationParams): Animation { ... }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Snapshot Integration**: Link animations to snapshots\n",
    "   ```typescript\n",
    "   getSnapshot(options): Snapshot {\n",
    "     // Include animation node if present\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Animations\n",
    "\n",
    "Once implemented, animations will be used in the Mol* Stories viewer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a snapshot with animated properties\n",
    "2. Export as MVSJ format\n",
    "3. Load in Mol* Stories viewer UI\n",
    "4. Animations will play automatically or on user interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Animation Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Animatable properties include:\n",
    "- **Color**: Component colors\n",
    "- **Opacity**: Component transparency\n",
    "- **Camera**: Position, target, up vector\n",
    "- **Canvas**: Background color\n",
    "- **Transform**: Rotation and translation matrices\n",
    "- **Clip**: Clipping plane/sphere/box parameters"
